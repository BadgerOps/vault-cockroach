## HashiCorp Vault single instance and Cockroach DB secure 3-node cluster

This setup is NOT PRODUCTION READY! 

It demonstrates how to use the Vault api to issue certificates for a secure CockroachDB cluster.
From a CockroachDB perspective the in-transit encryption between cockroach nodes can be considered secure. However, the Vault instance is not configured in a secure way (see production considerations).

To start the vault and cockroach db cluster:

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
````

### Open CockraochDB UI

USERNAME: jpointsman 
 
PASSWORD Q7gc8rEdS

```bash
open https://localhost:8080
````

### Open Vault UI

TOKEN: on disk in ./vault-token/root.token

```bash
open https://localhost:8200
````

### CockroachDB considerations
For a production-ready setup you should take at least the following into consideration:

- Don't start the first node without a --join option. On reboot this node might go transition to a single node cluster.
- Consider discovering your nodes in the cluster with a service discovery tool like [Consul](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template) instead of explicitly specifying the --join on all nodes  
- Expose ports 26257 and 8080 on all cockroach nodes and use a loadbalancer 

### Vault considerations
For a production-ready setup you should take at least the following into consideration:

- Don't use the tls_disable property for accessing the vault in production.
- Don't init the vault with -key-shares=1 -key-threshold=1 unless you are considering [auto-unseal](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/operations/ops-autounseal-aws-kms)
- Don't run dev server in production
- You must store your unseal and root token in a safe place
- You should not use the root token to generate certificates. Instead create a role and [policy](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/policies.html)
- You should run vault in [HA mode](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/operations/ops-vault-ha-consul) (with consul)
- You should backup your vault
- You should make a plan for rotating your intermediate CA
- You should make a plan and monitor and [alert](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/ca8fa726de54a0feea9f33ad000e883a4168ef39/monitoring/rules/alerts.rules.yml#L91) for cockroachdb expiring certificates
- You should revoke certificates that are not used anymore
- Consider using an existing CA to sign your intermediate CA instead of generating one with Vault
